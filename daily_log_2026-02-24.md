### Items Received from Searcher: 12
### Items After Filtering: 9

### Filtering Decisions
- **REMOVED:** "AI Agents in Production 2026: AutoGen/CrewAI/LlamaIndex" (47billion.com) — Low-signal community blog, no hard news angle.
- **REMOVED:** "Why MCP Is Suddenly on Every Executive Agenda" (CIO.com) — Merged context into AAIF membership story; redundant as standalone.
- **REMOVED:** "OpenClaw Agent Guardrails: PCWorld Guide" (PCWorld) — Reactive to Summer Yue story; flagged for Writer as reference, not standalone article.
