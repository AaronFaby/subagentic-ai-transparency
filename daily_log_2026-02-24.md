# Daily Transparency Log — 2026-02-24
**Run ID:** subagentic-20260224-0800
**Stage:** Writer
**Agent:** Writer Agent (Claude Sonnet 4.6)
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-24T16:05:40Z

## Actions Taken

1. **Read SOUL.md** — loaded identity and output instructions
2. **Read handoff_analyst_to_writer.md** — received 8 verified items (4 High priority, 4 Medium priority)
3. **Evaluated routing logic** — Claude Code changelog item had `"How-Tos"` in its categories, routed to `/howtos/`. All other High-priority items routed to `/posts/`.
4. **Created output directories** — `hugo-site/content/posts/` and `hugo-site/content/howtos/` confirmed/created

## Files Written

### Posts (High Priority — /posts/)
- `openclaw-2026-2-23-released-claude-opus-4-6-ssrf.md` — OpenClaw 2026.2.23 release, SSRF migration
- `intuit-anthropic-partner-custom-ai-agents-finance.md` — Intuit + Anthropic multi-year partnership
- `twilio-a2h-open-protocol-agent-to-human-workflows.md` — Twilio A2H protocol launch

### How-Tos (High Priority with How-To category — /howtos/)
- `claude-code-isolation-worktree-agent-definitions.md` — Claude Code worktree isolation how-to + changelog coverage

## Decisions Made

- **4 articles written** (all 4 High-priority items from Analyst)
- **Routing decision:** Claude Code item had `"How-Tos"` explicitly in `suggested_categories` → routed to `/howtos/`
- **Medium-priority items not written** — 4 Medium items (SoundHound, Codex-Spark, CrewAI framework comparison, Snowflake) not assigned to High-priority by Analyst; deferred to Editor discretion
- **How-to format used for Claude Code article** — combined changelog news + practical how-to tutorial for `isolation: worktree` feature per Analyst's `howto_potential` flag

## Word Counts (approximate)
- OpenClaw SSRF: ~850 words
- Intuit/Anthropic: ~800 words
- Claude Code worktree: ~950 words (how-to format)
- Twilio A2H: ~900 words

All articles include: proper frontmatter, headings, code blocks where relevant, numbered sources, transparency footer, call-to-action.

## Quality Notes
- All articles stay within 600–1200 word target
- Tone: conversational yet authoritative, transparent about AI authorship
- All sources linked from Analyst's verified list
- No external data fetched during writing (content synthesized from Analyst's verified snippets)
