## Pipeline Run: subagentic-20260228-0800

### Searcher
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-28T16:05:00Z
- Items found: 12
- Confidence: 88/100
- Tools used: Brave News API (freshness=pd, freshness=pw), web_search, grok-x-search, web_fetch (GitHub releases, Clawbot AI press release)
- Key topics:
  - Trump/Anthropic/Pentagon ban — Claude declared "supply chain risk," lawsuit filed
  - Clawbot AI launches SaaS/cloud-hosted OpenClaw (today, Feb 28)
  - ClawJacked vulnerability — websites can hijack OpenClaw agents (patched)
  - IBM forecasts 2026 super-agent era with control planes and objective-validation
  - Social Arena: live benchmark pitting 5 AI models as autonomous X agents
  - Agentic AI identity/security imperative (non-human identities at scale)
- Notes: Heavy overlap filter applied — 9 topics from prior 7 days excluded (Perplexity Computer, OpenClaw v2026.2.26, IronCurtain, CORPGEN, Oasis vuln, etc.). Anthropic/Pentagon story dominates today's news cycle — massive signal, directly relevant to agentic AI policy. Light day for pure OpenClaw releases; compensating with high-quality ecosystem stories.

### Analyst
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-28T16:06:00Z
- Items after filtering: 10
- High priority: 3
- Confidence: 82/100
- Items removed: 2 ("ClawJacked" OpenClaw vuln — same CVE-2026-25253/Oasis Security disclosure already published, excluded by overlap filter; OpenClaw v2026.2.27 — mislabeled by Searcher, features belong to v2026.2.26 which is already excluded)
- Items demoted: 1 (Clawbot AI SaaS: HIGH→MEDIUM — single PR wire source, no independent editorial coverage)
- Title correction: 1 (Anthropic/Pentagon — lawsuit not yet "filed," Anthropic said it "will challenge in court")
- How-to flags: 2 (Clawbot AI SaaS managed deployment tutorial; Social Arena benchmark custom agent replication)
- Notes: Anthropic/Pentagon ban is the dominant story of the day — confirmed across 10+ tier-1 outlets. ClawJacked removal was key catch: Searcher claimed distinct angle from published Oasis post but same CVE/discoverer. v2026.2.27 was a Searcher labeling error (actual release is v2026.2.26). Jensen Huang item is at 48h boundary (Feb 26) — retained as borderline. Social Arena benchmark confirmed live and genuinely novel.

### Writer
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-28T16:09:00Z
- Articles written: 3
- Titles:
  - "Anthropic Vows Court Fight After Trump Bans Claude from U.S. Government — Pentagon Labels It a Supply Chain Risk"
  - "Social Arena: Five AI Models Compete as Fully Autonomous X Agents in Live Real-World Benchmark"
  - "How to Build Your Own Autonomous Social Media Agent (and What Social Arena's Live AI Battle Teaches Us)"
- Folders used: posts (2), howtos (1)
- Word counts: ~950 words, ~900 words, ~850 words
- Notes: Wrote both High-priority items as news posts. Selected Social Arena as the how-to piece — strongest technical blueprint for our practitioner audience. Clawbot AI SaaS (Medium, single PR wire) skipped in favor of the more editorially substantive how-to. Anthropic/Pentagon article treats "lawsuit vowed" correctly per Analyst correction.

### Editor
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-28T16:13:00Z
- Articles reviewed: 3
- Articles published: 3
- Quality scores: "Anthropic/Pentagon: 96/100, Social Arena News: 93/100, Social Arena How-To: 92/100"
- Fixes applied: None needed — all articles passed review. Confirmed Anthropic article correctly uses "vows court fight" (not "filed lawsuit") per Analyst correction. Transparency footers present on all three. Frontmatter valid on all three.
- Build status: SUCCESS — 512 pages, 0 errors, 182ms (hugo v0.156.0)
- Git commit: 6af44d8
- Notes: All 3 articles above 90/100 quality threshold. socialsarena.ai URL verified accessible at publish time. X API v2 curl OAuth syntax in how-to is current. Table formatting in Social Arena news post valid in Hugo markdown.

## Pipeline-Manager Final Review — subagentic-20260228-0800
**Author:** Pipeline-Manager (Claude Sonnet 4.6)
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-28 08:15 PST
**Status:** COMPLETE ✅

All 4 stages completed successfully. 3 articles published to subagentic.ai. Hugo build clean (512 pages, 0 errors). Git commit 6af44d8 pushed to AaronFaby/subagentic-ai-content. Cloudflare Pages auto-deploying.

**Sensitive data review:** No API keys, tokens, SSH key details, passwords, private file paths, or personal information detected in any handoff file or transparency log entries. Log is clean for public publication.

**Dominant story this run:** Anthropic/Pentagon ban — Trump administration declared Claude a supply chain risk, banned all federal agency use, stripped $200M DoD contract. Anthropic vowed court challenge. OpenAI immediately secured a Pentagon deal. Confirmed 10+ tier-1 outlets (Reuters, NYT, WaPo, Axios, NPR, Fortune, Politico, CBS, AP).

**Best new discovery:** Social Arena — Arcada Labs' live benchmark pitting 5 AI models as fully autonomous X social media agents. Genuinely novel; no prior coverage in our pipeline. Generated both a news article and a practitioner how-to.

**Analyst quality catches:** Two items correctly removed (ClawJacked = same Oasis CVE already excluded; OpenClaw v2026.2.27 = Searcher mislabeled v2026.2.26 features). One title corrected (lawsuit vowed, not yet filed). All catches preserved factual accuracy.
