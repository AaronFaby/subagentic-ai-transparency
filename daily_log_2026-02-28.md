## Pipeline Run: subagentic-20260228-0800

### Searcher
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-28T16:05:00Z
- Items found: 12
- Confidence: 88/100
- Tools used: Brave News API (freshness=pd, freshness=pw), web_search, grok-x-search, web_fetch (GitHub releases, Clawbot AI press release)
- Key topics:
  - Trump/Anthropic/Pentagon ban — Claude declared "supply chain risk," lawsuit filed
  - Clawbot AI launches SaaS/cloud-hosted OpenClaw (today, Feb 28)
  - ClawJacked vulnerability — websites can hijack OpenClaw agents (patched)
  - IBM forecasts 2026 super-agent era with control planes and objective-validation
  - Social Arena: live benchmark pitting 5 AI models as autonomous X agents
  - Agentic AI identity/security imperative (non-human identities at scale)
- Notes: Heavy overlap filter applied — 9 topics from prior 7 days excluded (Perplexity Computer, OpenClaw v2026.2.26, IronCurtain, CORPGEN, Oasis vuln, etc.). Anthropic/Pentagon story dominates today's news cycle — massive signal, directly relevant to agentic AI policy. Light day for pure OpenClaw releases; compensating with high-quality ecosystem stories.

### Analyst
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-28T16:06:00Z
- Items after filtering: 10
- High priority: 3
- Confidence: 82/100
- Items removed: 2 ("ClawJacked" OpenClaw vuln — same CVE-2026-25253/Oasis Security disclosure already published, excluded by overlap filter; OpenClaw v2026.2.27 — mislabeled by Searcher, features belong to v2026.2.26 which is already excluded)
- Items demoted: 1 (Clawbot AI SaaS: HIGH→MEDIUM — single PR wire source, no independent editorial coverage)
- Title correction: 1 (Anthropic/Pentagon — lawsuit not yet "filed," Anthropic said it "will challenge in court")
- How-to flags: 2 (Clawbot AI SaaS managed deployment tutorial; Social Arena benchmark custom agent replication)
- Notes: Anthropic/Pentagon ban is the dominant story of the day — confirmed across 10+ tier-1 outlets. ClawJacked removal was key catch: Searcher claimed distinct angle from published Oasis post but same CVE/discoverer. v2026.2.27 was a Searcher labeling error (actual release is v2026.2.26). Jensen Huang item is at 48h boundary (Feb 26) — retained as borderline. Social Arena benchmark confirmed live and genuinely novel.

### Writer
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-28T16:09:00Z
- Articles written: 3
- Titles:
  - "Anthropic Vows Court Fight After Trump Bans Claude from U.S. Government — Pentagon Labels It a Supply Chain Risk"
  - "Social Arena: Five AI Models Compete as Fully Autonomous X Agents in Live Real-World Benchmark"
  - "How to Build Your Own Autonomous Social Media Agent (and What Social Arena's Live AI Battle Teaches Us)"
- Folders used: posts (2), howtos (1)
- Word counts: ~950 words, ~900 words, ~850 words
- Notes: Wrote both High-priority items as news posts. Selected Social Arena as the how-to piece — strongest technical blueprint for our practitioner audience. Clawbot AI SaaS (Medium, single PR wire) skipped in favor of the more editorially substantive how-to. Anthropic/Pentagon article treats "lawsuit vowed" correctly per Analyst correction.

### Editor
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-28T16:13:00Z
- Articles reviewed: 3
- Articles published: 3
- Quality scores: "Anthropic/Pentagon: 96/100, Social Arena News: 93/100, Social Arena How-To: 92/100"
- Fixes applied: None needed — all articles passed review. Confirmed Anthropic article correctly uses "vows court fight" (not "filed lawsuit") per Analyst correction. Transparency footers present on all three. Frontmatter valid on all three.
- Build status: SUCCESS — 512 pages, 0 errors, 182ms (hugo v0.156.0)
- Git commit: 6af44d8
- Notes: All 3 articles above 90/100 quality threshold. socialsarena.ai URL verified accessible at publish time. X API v2 curl OAuth syntax in how-to is current. Table formatting in Social Arena news post valid in Hugo markdown.

## Pipeline-Manager Final Review — subagentic-20260228-0800
**Author:** Pipeline-Manager (Claude Sonnet 4.6)
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-28 08:15 PST
**Status:** COMPLETE ✅

All 4 stages completed successfully. 3 articles published to subagentic.ai. Hugo build clean (512 pages, 0 errors). Git commit 6af44d8 pushed to AaronFaby/subagentic-ai-content. Cloudflare Pages auto-deploying.

**Sensitive data review:** No API keys, tokens, SSH key details, passwords, private file paths, or personal information detected in any handoff file or transparency log entries. Log is clean for public publication.

**Dominant story this run:** Anthropic/Pentagon ban — Trump administration declared Claude a supply chain risk, banned all federal agency use, stripped $200M DoD contract. Anthropic vowed court challenge. OpenAI immediately secured a Pentagon deal. Confirmed 10+ tier-1 outlets (Reuters, NYT, WaPo, Axios, NPR, Fortune, Politico, CBS, AP).

**Best new discovery:** Social Arena — Arcada Labs' live benchmark pitting 5 AI models as fully autonomous X social media agents. Genuinely novel; no prior coverage in our pipeline. Generated both a news article and a practitioner how-to.

**Analyst quality catches:** Two items correctly removed (ClawJacked = same Oasis CVE already excluded; OpenClaw v2026.2.27 = Searcher mislabeled v2026.2.26 features). One title corrected (lawsuit vowed, not yet filed). All catches preserved factual accuracy.

## Pipeline Run: subagentic-20260228-2000

### Searcher
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-28T20:00:00-08:00 (2026-02-29T04:00:00Z)
- Items found: 12
- Confidence: 86/100
- Tools used: news-search (Brave News API), web_search, grok-x-search
- Key topics:
  - OpenClaw hits 300k–400k users; Clawbot AI launches hosted SaaS cloud version
  - ClawJacked vuln (CVE-2026-25253) detailed by Hacker News / Hacked.com — still circulating heavily (already published: oasis-security-openclaw-critical-vulnerability-chain, audit-lock-down-openclaw-oasis-vulnerability — skip)
  - OWASP Top 10 for Agentic AI (2026) — new practical breakdown with 43k+ scanned skills
  - OpenAI secures Pentagon deal as Anthropic faces supply-chain blacklist — already published (anthropic-pentagon-trump-ban-claude-supply-chain-risk) but major follow-ons today: Dario defiant, Claude hits #1 App Store, Google+OpenAI employees solidarity letter
  - Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) grows to 146 members — Huawei joins, 18 new Gold Members
  - Claude Cowork: new enterprise plugin marketplace (finance/HR/design) — already published (claude-cowork-now-runs-scheduled-recurring-tasks-autonomously-while-you-sleep) but new angle: SaaSpocalypse fear angle and Cowork autonomous scheduling
  - Arcada Labs autonomous X benchmark — ALREADY PUBLISHED (social-arena-five-ai-models-autonomous-x-agents-benchmark)
  - Perplexity Computer enterprise multi-model agent — already published (perplexity-launches-computer-super-agent-19-models)
  - AI agents making multi-million dollar enterprise decisions (Inc.com)
  - Samsung bets on agentic AI for global factory transformation by 2030 (MWC 2026)
  - New benchmark: OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications — real-world detection guide
  - Clawbot AI launches SaaS/cloud version of OpenClaw with built-in AI model routing
- Notes: ClawJacked CVE coverage is very high today but the core story is already published. Anthropic Pentagon story has significant follow-on (Claude #1 App Store, solidarity letter, Dario CBS interview) — strong update angle available. Light on fresh OpenClaw version releases (v2026.2.27/2026.2.28 not found in 24h window). AAIF growth + Huawei joining is a fresh angle. Clawbot cloud SaaS is a new standalone item.

### Analyst
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-29T04:10:00Z
- Items after filtering: 9
- High priority: 4
- Confidence: 85/100
- Items removed: 2 (OpenClaw user count claim — Business Insider reports #1, TechCrunch/Gizmodo/Bitcoinworld report #2; ranking fluctuated — title corrected to "surges to top of App Store" to reflect both sources accurately; Institutional Investor 300k-400k user count — single financial media source, no independent verification of claim, demoted to Low and flagged)
- Wait — correcting count: Items removed = 1 (OpenClaw Institutional Investor user count article — unverifiable 300k-400k claim, no corroborating source); Items demoted = 2 (AAIF 146 members: 72-96h old, borderline 48h window, kept as high-importance exception at Medium; Clawbot SaaS: same single PR wire source as 08:00 run, no new editorial coverage)
- Items after filtering: 9 (from 12 — 1 removed, 2 demoted, 1 title-corrected)
- How-to flags: 3 (SkyPilot cloud VM isolation for OpenClaw; OWASP Top 10 agentic detection guide; Samsung digital-twin factory AI setup)
- Notes: Claude App Store ranking story requires title correction — ranking fluctuated between #1 (Business Insider, CNBC) and #2 (TechCrunch, Gizmodo, Bitcoinworld) throughout the day; using "surges to top" framing. Solidarity letter (Feb 27, ~26h old) not covered in 08:00 run — confirmed fresh. Samsung factory story corroborated by 4 independent sources including official Samsung Newsroom. OWASP Top 10 Agentic dev.to article confirmed today with multiple secondaries. SkyPilot isolation how-to confirmed 48h window, strong how-to angle post-ClawJacked news cycle.

- Articles written: 5
- Titles:
  - Claude Surges to Top of App Store as ChatGPT Users Defect Over Anthropic's Pentagon Stand

- Folders used: posts (4 news articles), howtos (1 how-to)
- Word counts: ~800, ~850, ~850, ~800, ~900 words (approx)
- Notes: Wrote all 4 High-priority items + 1 best how-to (SkyPilot isolation). Analyst recommended 2+1 minimum; all 4 Highs were distinct enough to warrant full coverage. SkyPilot how-to selected over OWASP as primary how-to due to stronger practitioner angle and direct post-ClawJacked relevance. AAIF/Clawbot/Low items deferred.

- Fixes applied: None needed — all articles passed quality review. All 5 verified as leaf bundles (folder/index.md format). Cover blocks confirmed in all frontmatter. Transparency footers present on all five. Frontmatter valid on all five (draft: false, correct categories, date fields). Article titles, accuracy, tone, SEO descriptions, and sourcing all passed review.
- Cover images: claude-surges-to-top: generated | dario-amodei-cbs: generated (1 retry, initial 500 error from API) | google-openai-letter: generated | samsung-factories: generated | skypilot-howto: generated
- Build status: SUCCESS — 522 pages, 0 errors, 268ms (hugo v0.156.0-extended)
- Git commit: 1e3a60e
- Notes: Anthropic/Pentagon theme runs through 3 of 4 news articles — writer note about editorial diversity (Samsung provides balance) is accurate. All 3 Pentagon-themed articles are distinct enough to stand alone. How-to (SkyPilot isolation) is well-timed post-ClawJacked CVE-2026-25253 and has strong practitioner value.

**Run result:** SUCCESS
