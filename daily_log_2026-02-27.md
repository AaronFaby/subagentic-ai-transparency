## Stage 2 — Analyst

**Agent:** Analyst (Claude Sonnet 4.6)
**Completed:** 2026-02-27T08:22 PST
**Input Items:** 13
**Output Items:** 6
**Items Removed:** 7
**Confidence:** 88/100

**Items Removed (with reasoning):**
- IronCurtain — confirmed duplicate: `ironcurtain-open-source-ai-agent-security-sandboxing.md` (run: subagentic-20260226-2000)
- Perplexity Computer — confirmed duplicate: `perplexity-launches-computer-super-agent-19-models.md` (run: subagentic-20260225-2000)
- Oasis Security vulnerability — confirmed duplicate: `oasis-security-openclaw-critical-vulnerability-chain.md` (run: subagentic-20260226-2000)
- Anthropic acquires Vercept — confirmed duplicate: `anthropic-acquires-vercept-claude-computer-use.md` (run: subagentic-20260225-2000)
- Agentic Frameworks 2026 (Softmax) — too similar to existing `which-agent-framework-2026-crewai-microsoft-langgraph.md`; no novel angle
- Anthropic Pentagon rejection — LOW priority; defense/policy tangent, insufficient audience value
- Multi-Agent coordination patterns (DEV.to) — MEDIUM/Low; generic, no OpenClaw-specific hook, no time urgency

**Items Retained (6):**
- OpenClaw v2026.2.26 release (HIGH — flagship tool, fresh today, 2+ sources confirmed)
- Claude Cowork scheduled tasks (HIGH — distinct from prior Cowork post, Anthropic official release notes confirmed)
- MiniMax MaxClaw (HIGH — first cloud OpenClaw offering, not covered, 4+ sources confirmed)
- GitGuardian MCP integration (MEDIUM — strong how-to potential, official blog primary source)
- NIST AI Agent Standards Initiative (MEDIUM — time-sensitive comment deadline, March/April hook)
- FastCompany journalist OpenClaw piece (MEDIUM — mainstream adoption signal, credible primary source)

**How-To Flags (3):**
1. OpenClaw external secrets management setup (v2026.2.26)
2. GitGuardian MCP integration for agentic pipelines
3. MaxClaw: deploy OpenClaw to cloud in 10 seconds (beginner tutorial)

### Analyst
**Timestamp:** 2026-02-28T04:05:30Z
- Items after filtering: 7
- High priority: 4
- Confidence: 88/100
- Items removed: 3 (1 low-relevance agentic framing [Anthropic/Pentagon], 1 generic/low-signal [tecnobits AI workflow guide], 1 downgraded to LOW due to existing site coverage overlap [ucstrategies OpenClaw 2.26 explainer — release already published])
- How-to flags: 3 (Claude Code Agent Teams multi-agent workflows; OpenClaw 101 local setup; OpenClaw AcpRuntime plugin — tutorial opportunity when feature ships)
- Notes: Searcher's "64k stars" for superpowers framework verified accurate (GitHub API: 64,985 stars). Google Opal confirmed via official Google Blog + reworked.co (3 sources). Agents of Chaos confirmed via arXiv 2602.20021 + Constellation Research + agentsofchaos.baulab.info. Claude Code memory confirmed via official Anthropic docs link. AcpRuntime GitHub issue #28511 live and active. ucstrategies OpenClaw 2.26 explainer overlaps with existing published post — kept at LOW rather than dropped entirely as angle differs slightly (practitioner ops focus vs release notes).
