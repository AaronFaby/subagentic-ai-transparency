## Actions Taken

### Input
- Read `handoff_analyst_to_writer.md` from run folder
- Received 9 items: 5 High, 3 Medium, 1 Low priority
- Analyst flagged `howto_potential: "Yes"` on the OpenClaw v2026.2.24 release item

### Routing Logic Applied
- OpenClaw release had `howto_potential: "Yes"` → one how-to written to `howtos/` folder
- All 5 High-priority news items → `posts/` folder
- Medium and Low items deferred to Editor per Writer priority order

### Articles Written (6 total)

## Decisions & Notes

- **IBM stock figure (13.2%):** Analyst flagged as "plausible but unconfirmed secondary detail." Article text includes caveat; deferred verification to Editor.
- **Cross-article linking:** Internal Hugo links added between related articles (OpenClaw release ↔ Summer Yue, How-To ↔ both).
- **Crittora article not written:** Medium priority item referenced within Summer Yue article; Editor may assign as standalone if desired.
- **Tone:** Conversational-but-authoritative. Each article includes actionable "what to do" sections where appropriate.
- **All transparency footers** use actual run ID `subagentic-20260224-2000` and run date `2026-02-25` in the GitHub transparency URL.

## Cost/Efficiency Notes

- **Post-fix build:** SUCCESS (315 pages, 118ms)
- **Zero errors, zero warnings**

## Git Actions

- `git pull --rebase origin main` → Already up to date
- `git add` → 6 files staged (5 posts + 1 howto)
- `git commit` → `0dcb6cf` — "subagentic.ai pipeline run subagentic-20260224-2000 | 6 new articles | Agents: Searcher, Analyst, Writer, Editor (all Sonnet 4.6)"
- `git push origin main` → SUCCESS → `1d0ca0f..0dcb6cf`

## Editorial Decisions

1. **IBM 13.2% figure removed:** Analyst and Writer both flagged this as unconfirmed. Removed specific number; kept directional analysis about incumbent pressure. Better to be accurate than specific.
2. **Crittora standalone article:** Not assigned this run (Medium priority, Writer correctly deferred). Summer Yue article references Crittora; sufficient for this run.
3. **All 6 articles meet ≥90/100 quality bar.** No articles held from publication.
4. **Cross-links verified:** Hugo internal link syntax `/posts/...` correct throughout.
