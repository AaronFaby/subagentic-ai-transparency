### Confidence Assessment

High confidence (85/100): Multiple corroborating sources for top items. Perplexity Computer and Vercept acquisition confirmed via 4+ outlets each. X/community buzz validated via Grok searches.
**Stage:** Searcher complete — handoff_searcher_to_analyst.md received. Spawning Analyst.

## Analyst Agent Run: subagentic-20260225-2000

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-25 20:07 PST
**Agent:** Analyst (Claude Sonnet 4.6)
**Run ID:** subagentic-20260225-2000

### Actions Taken

1. Read handoff_searcher_to_analyst.md — 13 items received
2. Fact-checked all 5 Searcher-priority items via independent web_search (Brave API)
3. Verified Vercept acquisition: 5 sources (TechCrunch, GeekWire, SiliconANGLE, OfficeChai, StockTwits) ✅
4. Verified Perplexity Computer launch: 6 sources (Semafor, PYMNTS, BusinessToday, Implicator, adwaitx) ✅
5. Verified Enterprise Agents Program: 4 sources (Forbes, VentureBeat, CNN, PYMNTS) ✅
6. Verified OpenClaw rogue incident: 5 sources (SF Standard, CyberNews, Indian Express, Futurism, Times Now) ✅ — flagged timestamp anomaly (20:30 PST published)
7. Verified Claude Code CVEs: 5 sources (Dark Reading, The Hacker News, Security Affairs, Check Point Research x2) ✅ — CVE-2025-59536, CVE-2026-21852 confirmed
8. Assessed OpenClaw Direct: press release wire only, no editorial coverage — downgraded confidence to 72, flagged as third-party service (not official openclaw.com)

### Filtering Decisions

- **Removed (4):** WIRED anti-bot story (editorial fit), CIO.com analysis (low new signal), Deutsche Telekom MINDR (niche/off-focus), Simon Willison Claude Code (likely duplicate of existing post)
- **Promoted:** Claude Code CVEs from priority 3 → High (critical security news with CVE numbers)
- **Flagged:** OpenClaw Direct must be identified as third-party, not official product

### Output

- Wrote: ~/subagentic-pipeline/pipeline/runs/current-run-subagentic-20260225-2000/handoff_analyst_to_writer.md
- Items passed to Writer: 9 (4 High, 5 Medium)
- 6 how-to opportunities flagged
- Confidence: 91/100
**Stage:** Analyst complete — handoff_analyst_to_writer.md received. Spawning Writer.

## Writer Agent Run: subagentic-20260225-2000

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-26 04:06 UTC (2026-02-25 20:06 PST)
**Agent:** Writer (Claude Sonnet 4.6)
**Run ID:** subagentic-20260225-2000

### Actions Taken

1. Read handoff_analyst_to_writer.md — 4 High priority items, 5 Medium, 6 how-to opportunities flagged
2. Verified run folder and created content directories (posts, howtos) as needed
3. Applied smart routing logic per SOUL.md:
   - Posts folder: all 4 High-priority news items
   - Howtos folder: 1 how-to (highest urgency: OpenClaw guardrails/rogue agent safety)

### Articles Written (4 news posts + 1 how-to)

| File | Category | Words (approx) |
|---|---|---|
| anthropic-acquires-vercept-claude-computer-use.md | Agentic AI News | ~900 |
| perplexity-launches-computer-super-agent-19-models.md | Agentic AI News | ~1000 |
| openclaw-goes-rogue-meta-ai-safety-email-inbox.md | Agentic AI News | ~1050 |
| critical-claude-code-flaws-rce-api-key-theft.md | Agentic AI News | ~1100 |
| how-to-add-guardrails-openclaw-agents-prevent-runaway-automation.md | How-Tos | ~1600 |

### Routing Decisions

- All 4 High-priority news items written as full posts → `hugo-site/content/posts/`
- How-to selected: OpenClaw guardrails/rogue-agent safety (highest urgency given rogue agent incident in today's news cycle — directly tied to a top High-priority story, maximum editorial relevance)
- Medium-priority items not written: sufficient High-priority content for this run; Medium items can carry to next cycle

### Quality Notes

- All articles include mandatory sections: Sources (numbered with links), Transparency footer (with correct run ID and date URL), Call-to-action to /about/agents/
- Frontmatter includes all required fields per SOUL.md
- All articles 600–1200 words (how-to ~1600 words, appropriate for depth of safety tutorial)
- Analyst caveat on OpenClaw rogue story timestamp (20:30 PST, possibly live-updating): article written conservatively without speculating on story evolution
- Cross-linked rogue-agent post and howto to each other for UX continuity

**Stage:** Writer complete — handoff_writer_to_editor.md created. Pipeline stage complete.
**Stage:** Writer complete — handoff_writer_to_editor.md received. Spawning Editor.

### Deduplication Note

After writing 4 news posts and checking existing content, Writer discovered that `summer-yue-openclaw-inbox-deletion-compaction-guardrails.md` (from run subagentic-20260224-2000) already covered the Summer Yue rogue agent incident. The new post `openclaw-goes-rogue-meta-ai-safety-email-inbox.md` was removed.

Final article count: 3 news posts + 1 how-to = 4 files created this run.

The guardrails how-to (`how-to-add-guardrails-openclaw-agents-prevent-runaway-automation.md`) is new content — no prior how-to covered this topic — and was retained.

## Editor Agent Run: subagentic-20260225-2000

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-25 20:10 PST
**Agent:** Editor (Claude Sonnet 4.6)
**Run ID:** subagentic-20260225-2000

### Actions Taken

1. Read handoff_writer_to_editor.md — 5 articles listed (4 news posts + 1 how-to)
2. Discovered Writer logged `openclaw-goes-rogue-meta-ai-safety-email-inbox.md` in handoff but file does not exist — `summer-yue-openclaw-inbox-deletion-compaction-guardrails.md` (published in prior run subagentic-20260224-2000) covers this story. Already live.
3. Read all 4 new articles in full for quality review
4. **Fixed broken cross-links** (2 occurrences) in:
   - `perplexity-launches-computer-super-agent-19-models.md` — link updated from `/posts/openclaw-goes-rogue-meta-ai-safety-email-inbox` → `/posts/summer-yue-openclaw-inbox-deletion-compaction-guardrails/`
   - `how-to-add-guardrails-openclaw-agents-prevent-runaway-automation.md` — same link fix
5. Ran `hugo --minify` build test: **SUCCESS** (372 pages, 0 errors, 131ms)
6. Quality scored all 4 new articles: 93–95/100 — all above 90/100 threshold
7. `git pull --rebase origin main` → already up to date
8. `git add` — 4 new files staged
9. `git commit` — hash: `965d37a`
10. `git push origin main` → SUCCESS

### Quality Scores

| Article | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| anthropic-acquires-vercept-claude-computer-use.md | 95/100 | Strong analysis, excellent SEO, good sources |
| perplexity-launches-computer-super-agent-19-models.md | 94/100 | Cross-link fixed, solid structure |
| critical-claude-code-flaws-rce-api-key-theft.md | 93/100 | Urgent security piece, correctly defers to official advisory for patch version |
| how-to-add-guardrails-openclaw-agents-prevent-runaway-automation.md | 94/100 | 1600 words (exceeds 1200 limit for how-tos but depth justified for safety tutorial); cross-link fixed |

### Editorial Decisions

- **Summer Yue rogue-agent article:** Already published from prior run (subagentic-20260224-2000). Writer handoff listed a new filename but did not create the file. No duplicate published. Cross-links updated to existing URL. No action needed.
- **How-to word count:** 1600 words vs 1200 typical limit — justified for a complete safety tutorial with 6 patterns + worked example. Approved.
- **CVE article:** Correctly instructs readers to verify patched version at official Anthropic advisory rather than hardcoding a version number. Appropriate caution.

### Articles Published: 4 (not 5 — rogue incident article was already live from prior run)
**Stage:** Editor complete — handoff_editor_complete.md written. Pipeline complete.

**Stage:** Pipeline-Manager — all stages complete. Pushing transparency log to GitHub.
