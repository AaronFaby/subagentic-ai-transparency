## Writer Run: subagentic-20260224-2000

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-25T04:06:06Z
**Agent:** Writer Agent (Claude Sonnet 4.6)
**Stage:** Writer (3rd stage of pipeline)

---

## Actions Taken

### Input
- Read `handoff_analyst_to_writer.md` from run folder
- Received 9 items: 5 High, 3 Medium, 1 Low priority
- Analyst flagged `howto_potential: "Yes"` on the OpenClaw v2026.2.24 release item

### Routing Logic Applied
- OpenClaw release had `howto_potential: "Yes"` → one how-to written to `howtos/` folder
- All 5 High-priority news items → `posts/` folder
- Medium and Low items deferred to Editor per Writer priority order

### Articles Written (6 total)

| File | Words | Priority | Folder |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| openclaw-v20260224-multilingual-stop-android-trust-model.md | ~950 | High #1 | posts/ |
| summer-yue-openclaw-inbox-deletion-compaction-guardrails.md | ~1,000 | High #2 | posts/ |
| anthropic-deepseek-moonshot-minimax-distillation-16m-queries.md | ~900 | High #3 | posts/ |
| anthropic-claude-cowork-enterprise-plugin-marketplace-finance-hr-design.md | ~950 | High #4 | posts/ |
| google-antigravity-openclaw-gemini-oauth-ban-wave.md | ~1,050 | High #5 | posts/ |
| configure-multilingual-stop-phrases-openclaw-v20260224.md | ~1,100 | How-To | howtos/ |

### Handoff Created
- `handoff_writer_to_editor.md` written to run folder

---

## Decisions & Notes

- **IBM stock figure (13.2%):** Analyst flagged as "plausible but unconfirmed secondary detail." Article text includes caveat; deferred verification to Editor.
- **Cross-article linking:** Internal Hugo links added between related articles (OpenClaw release ↔ Summer Yue, How-To ↔ both).
- **Crittora article not written:** Medium priority item referenced within Summer Yue article; Editor may assign as standalone if desired.
- **Tone:** Conversational-but-authoritative. Each article includes actionable "what to do" sections where appropriate.
- **All transparency footers** use actual run ID `subagentic-20260224-2000` and run date `2026-02-25` in the GitHub transparency URL.

---

## Cost/Efficiency Notes

- 6 articles written in a single session pass
- No web fetches required (all research pre-verified by Analyst)
- All slugs under 60 characters per SOUL.md spec

## Quality Review Results

| Article | Score | Issues Found | Action Taken |
|---------|-------|--------------|--------------|
| OpenClaw v2026.2.24 release | 95/100 | None | Published as-is |
| Summer Yue inbox incident | 96/100 | None | Published as-is |
| Anthropic/DeepSeek distillation | 94/100 | None | Published as-is |
| Claude Cowork enterprise | 93/100 | IBM 13.2% unverified stat | **Fixed**: removed specific % figure, softened section header to "Enterprise Incumbents Signal", kept directional analysis intact |
| Google/Antigravity ban wave | 95/100 | None | Published as-is |
| How-To: Multilingual stop phrases | 94/100 | None | Published as-is |

**All articles passed:** Accuracy ✅ | Tone ✅ | Engagement ✅ | SEO meta ✅ | Transparency footer ✅ | Hugo frontmatter ✅

## Hugo Build

- **Pre-fix build:** SUCCESS (315 pages, 119ms)
- **Post-fix build:** SUCCESS (315 pages, 118ms)
- **Zero errors, zero warnings**

## Git Actions

- `git pull --rebase origin main` → Already up to date
- `git add` → 6 files staged (5 posts + 1 howto)
- `git commit` → `0dcb6cf` — "subagentic.ai pipeline run subagentic-20260224-2000 | 6 new articles | Agents: Searcher, Analyst, Writer, Editor (all Sonnet 4.6)"
- `git push origin main` → SUCCESS → `1d0ca0f..0dcb6cf`

## Editorial Decisions

1. **IBM 13.2% figure removed:** Analyst and Writer both flagged this as unconfirmed. Removed specific number; kept directional analysis about incumbent pressure. Better to be accurate than specific.
2. **Crittora standalone article:** Not assigned this run (Medium priority, Writer correctly deferred). Summer Yue article references Crittora; sufficient for this run.
3. **All 6 articles meet ≥90/100 quality bar.** No articles held from publication.
4. **Cross-links verified:** Hugo internal link syntax `/posts/...` correct throughout.

## Analyst Run: subagentic-20260225-0800

**Agent:** Analyst (Claude Sonnet 4.6)
**Stage:** Analyst (2nd stage of pipeline)

### Input
- Read `handoff_searcher_to_analyst.md` from run folder
- Received 12 items: 5 High, 5 Medium, 2 Low from Searcher

### Verification Actions Taken

| Item | Method | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| Claude Code Remote Control | web_search (5 results, multiple major outlets) | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| KiloClaw GA | web_search + web_fetch blog.kilo.ai | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| GitHub multi-agent blog | web_search + URL confirmed on github.blog | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| Quill/Apono security | web_search + web_fetch PR Newswire primary source | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| OpenClaw v2026.2.24 | web_fetch GitHub release page (direct) | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| DeerFlow/ByteDance | web_fetch GitHub (404) + web_search (0 results) | ❌ DROPPED — UNVERIFIABLE |
| Salesforce Q4 earnings | web_search (financialcontent + SeekingAlpha) | ✅ CONFIRMED |
| Agentic AI Foundation | PR Newswire (sole source) | ⚠️ PARTIAL — single primary source |
| Amazon Ads MCP | Futurum Group (sole source) | ⚠️ PARTIAL — Writer to verify |
| RIP GitHub Actions | Source quality + overlap check | ❌ DROPPED — low signal/overlap |
| Git Worktrees DEV.to | Overlap check vs. existing howtos/ | ⚠️ LOW — overlap with existing content |
| Claude Code v2.1.56 | Previously confirmed in Searcher | ❌ DROPPED — absorbed into RC story |

### Decisions
- Dropped DeerFlow: GitHub 404, zero search results, sole source = Medium community post. Flag as potential hallucination by Searcher.
- Dropped RIP GitHub Actions: geeky-gadgets.com low trust, overlaps Feb 23 coverage.
- Dropped Claude Code v2.1.56: minor patch notes, no standalone value.
- Upgraded Salesforce earnings: Distinct from Feb 23 strategy piece — real numbers ($11.18B, 114% ARR growth) warrant fresh article.
- Flagged DAVE voice claim in OpenClaw v2026.2.24: not found in fetched GitHub changelog — Writer must verify before publishing.
- Identified OpenClaw security story cluster (Quill + Microsoft warning + 6 CVEs + Apono) — recommended to Editor as potential roundup.

### Output
- Wrote `handoff_analyst_to_writer.md` to run folder
- 9 items: 5 High / 3 Medium / 1 Low
- Overall confidence: 88/100
- **Stage:** Analyst complete → Spawning Writer

### Hugo Build
- **Build result:** SUCCESS (344 pages, 122ms)
- **Zero errors, zero warnings**

### Git Actions
- `git pull --rebase origin main` → Already up to date
- `git add` → 5 files staged (3 howtos + 2 posts)
- `git commit` → `679c68e` — "subagentic.ai pipeline run subagentic-20260225-0800 | 5 new articles | Agents: Searcher, Analyst, Writer, Editor (all Sonnet 4.6)"

### Editorial Decisions
1. **All 5 articles met ≥90/100 quality bar.** No articles held from publication.
2. **DAVE voice exclusion confirmed correct:** No confirming source found; claim remains excluded.
3. **Amazon Ads MCP:** Correctly deferred. Sole-source Futurum Group article should not publish without secondary confirmation.
4. **OpenClaw Security Roundup:** Flagged by Analyst — "The OpenClaw Security Reckoning" — strong evergreen candidate. Recommend commissioning in next run with fresh Searcher pass on the CVE cluster.
5. **4 skipped items (3 Medium, 1 Low):** Writer's scope decisions respected. None warranted overriding the threshold for this run.
